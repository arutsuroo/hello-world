# hello-world


Time doesnt pass, the passage of time is an illusion, and the time is the maggician. You remember being alive yestreday, you hope you're being alive tomorrow, so it feels lie you are traveling. Movies don't really movie, they're just pictures, lots and lots of pictures. None of them moving, just frozen moments. But if you have experience one after the othe, than everything comes alive!
